# StockMarketAgenticAssistant

**StockMarketAgenticAssistant** is a modular AI-driven system designed to interact with financial data through specialized microservices, each functioning as an independent agent. The project demonstrates how agent-based systems can be used to analyze, retrieve, and communicate insights from stock market data using natural language and voice interfaces.

## Overview

The system is built around the concept of autonomous agents, where each agent is responsible for a distinct task such as analysis, data retrieval, language generation, or voice interaction. These agents operate independently as FastAPI microservices and communicate via REST APIs to collaboratively fulfill user queries.

## Core Agents

- **Analysis Agent**: Performs stock market analysis and generates insights using machine learning techniques.
- **API Agent**: Handles communication with external financial APIs to fetch real-time or historical market data.
- **Scraping Agent**: Collects data from various financial news websites or portals to enrich the dataset.
- **Language Generation Agent**: Converts raw data or analytical results into coherent natural language summaries.
- **Retrieval Agent**: Finds relevant documents or past data using vector-based similarity search with tools like Pinecone.
- **Voice Agent**: Enables voice-based interaction by converting speech to text and generating spoken responses.

## Design Philosophy

The assistant is designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Modularity**: Each agent is a standalone service, allowing independent development and scaling.
- **Interoperability**: Agents communicate using lightweight APIs, enabling flexible orchestration.
- **Extensibility**: New agents or capabilities can be added without affecting existing components.
- **Domain Focus**: The system is specialized for financial tasks, making it adaptable for fintech applications.

## Applications

This architecture supports a range of financial applications, such as:

- Automated stock trend analysis and commentary
- Voice-driven financial query answering
- Real-time news aggregation and summarization
- Intelligent retrieval of market reports or earnings summaries

## Motivation

The project explores the integration of AI capabilities—such as NLP, voice interfaces, and data analysis—into an agentic system that mimics how financial professionals might collaborate to make informed decisions. It demonstrates the potential for building intelligent assistants that are not monolithic, but composed of smaller, specialized services.
